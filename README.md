# Santorini â™Ÿ

For this project we were randomly paired with another student, and given 48h to code one of 2 board games: Santorini or Hive.

We chose to do Santorini in C.

You should familiarize yourself with the game rules before playing, so you can better understand our interfaces instructions.
They can be found here: [The official game rules](https://cdn.1j1ju.com/medias/fc/ec/5d-santorini-rulebook.pdf)


## Usage

After you clone the repository:

    1. make
    2. ./santorini
    3. Good luck!

## Improvement ideas:

    1. Adding the possibility of viewing the game rules and goals that apply to our version before starting the game.
    2. The interface's usability could be improved by simpifying the input method.
