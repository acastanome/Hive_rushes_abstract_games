# Santorini

For this project we were randomly paired with another student, and given 48h to code one of 2 board games: Santorini or Hive.

We chose to do Santorini in C.

You can find the link to [The official game rules](https://cdn.1j1ju.com/medias/fc/ec/5d-santorini-rulebook.pdf) here,

or run the game and read the simplified instructions we have provided there. For that, follow the Usage instructions below.

## Usage

After you clone the repository:

    1. In the repo directory, make
    2. ./santorini

Have fun!
